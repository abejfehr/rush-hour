# Rush Hour Game

~ make cars look nicer

- make exit label smaller on iPhones
- make something better happen once the game is fully beaten

nice to have

- animate the red car when it exits
- flip some cars (except the red car)

bugs

- fix dragging when scrolled
  - maybe prevent scroll in every scenario?
