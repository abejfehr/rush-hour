# Rush Hour Game

~ remove previous and next buttons (or only show them for localhost)

- make exit label smaller on iPhones
- make cars look nicer
- make something better happen once the game is fully beaten
- fix exit being overtop of the red car
- make text and other elements unselectable

nice to have

- animate the red car when it exits
- flip some cars (except the red car)

bugs

- fix dragging when scrolled
  - maybe prevent scroll in every scenario?
