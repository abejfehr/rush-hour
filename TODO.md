# Rush Hour Game

- make dragging work on iOS
- put it on github
- animate red car exiting
- add a tutorial or instructions
- make cars look nicer
- style the exit better
  - like this maybe: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mads-Haahr/publication/333226463/figure/fig4/AS:760838797414403@1558409513560/Screenshot-from-Rush-Hour-1996_Q320.jpg
- make something better happen once the game is beaten
- rename the levels file and document how I got it

nice to have

- animate vehicle snapping
- flip some cars (except the red car)

bugs

- fix dragging when scrolled
  - maybe prevent scroll in every scenario?
